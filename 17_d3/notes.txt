Notes
- agree w/ the introduction: using and breaking an example leads to learning & itâ€™s being resourceful
- this reading for #6 makes me more appreciative of d3
- d3 is very helpful for quick statistics
- very flexible and malleable; the dynamic data is interesting in that it enables user to alter
- the interactive animation is cool; seems very graph/chart focused 
- really like the d3.selectall() function; easily grabs all related variables to affect
- simplistic and efficient when organizing and displaying data & when coding
- transition is also cool
