Notes



00/index.html

Observations:
- 5 blue horizontal bars are displayed
- they are different sizes
- their sizes seem to correspond to the numbers at their far right end
- the sizes have to be manually arranged in this case
- the diagram is overall small and uncomfortable to the eye
- clicking on the diagram or any whitespace gives no reaction
- it seems likes its just a simple bar graph 

Comments:
- could be larger
- good for data displays if necessary on a webpage
- simple and clean
- seems time consuming to have to manually write out each bar
	- have to write each width, each number, and just each one of them by hand

//Init your data:
var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];

Observations:
- webpage displays nothing
- console shows number of elements and list
    
Comments:
- sets up a list for the bar graph to get its numbers


//Select your chart.
var chart = d3.select(".chart");

Observations:
- webpage displays nothing
- console shows Pt {_groups: Array(1), _parents: Array(1)}
	- within that, there are various parts such as groups and parents
	- within those, there are functions and objects
    
Prediction:
- seems to be to select the type for the "chart" variable
    
Comments:
- looking up what d3.select(parameter) does:
	- it is a function to select the first element that matches the specified string
	- basically, it selects the DOM elements specified in parameter


//Prepare for data join.
var bar = chart.selectAll("div");

Observations:
- webpage displays nothing
- console shows same as previous

Comments:
- by selecting all DOM elements with “div”, variable “bar” can be used to group them all together
	- makes for easier selection


(this defines selection to which you will join data)

//Join your data.
var barUpdate = bar.data(data);

Observations:
- webpage displays nothing
- console shows Pt {_groups: Array(1), _parents: Array(1), _enter: Array(1), _exit: Array(1)}
	- within there are more things besides groups and parents such as exit and enter


//Instantiate new elements by appending to the “enter selection.”
var barEnter = barUpdate.enter().append("div");

Observations:
- on webpage, five thin blue bars appear
- they extend to the end of the webpage horizontally
- they look simply like blue stripes


//Set width of each bar proportional to its data value.
barEnter.style("width", function(d) {
return d * 10 + "px"; });

Observations:
- these set the widths of the bars automatically depending on the values in the list called “data”
- the bars have lengths proportional to the values in the list
- the order of the size of the bars follow the order of the values in the list

Comments:
- they look even smaller than before
- very uncomfortable to look at/ strains the eyes
- doesn’t look much of a bar graph at the moment


//Label each bar.
barEnter.text(function(d) { return d; });

Observations
- the bars became thicker
- white numbers are attached at the far right end corresponding to the width of their respective bars
- the bars are in vertical order of the “data” list of numbers

Questions:
- why do the bars suddenly become thicker?
- do the numbers cause the sudden change in width?
- why are the number placed at the end of the bars?
